## Assignment 1
 # 1. Create a JSON file (employee.json) containing employee information of minimum 5 employees. Each employee information consists of Name, DOB, Height, City, State. Write a python program that reads this information from the JSON file and saves the information into a list of objects of Employee class. Finally print the list of the Employee objects.

import json
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, dob, height, city, state):
        self.name = name
        self.dob = dob
        self.height = height
        self.city = city
        self.state = state

# Create employee data
employee_data = {
    "employees": [
        {
            "Name":    "Manikandan",
            "DOB":     "24-02-2001",
            "Height":   185,
            "City":    "Ramanathapuram",
            "State":   "Tamilnadu"
        },
        {
            "Name":    "vignesh",
            "DOB":     "25-05-2000",
            "Height":   178,
            "City":    "Chennai",
            "State":   "Tamilnadu"
        },
        {
            "Name":    "Karthik",
            "DOB":     "08-10-1998",
            "Height":   170,
            "City":    "Banglore",
            "State":   "Karnataka"
        },
        {
            "Name":    "siva",
            "DOB":     "02-07-2002",
            "Height":   180,
            "City":    "Trivandrum",
            "State":   "kerala"
        },
        {
            "Name":    "Ram",
            "DOB":     "17-09-2002",
            "Height":   187,
            "City":    "Mumbai",
            "State":   "Maharastra"
        }
    ]
}
with open('employee.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(employee_data, file)

with open('employee.json') as file:
    data = json.load(file)
    employee_list = []
    for employee_data in data['employees']:
        name = employee_data['Name']
        dob = employee_data['DOB']
        height = employee_data['Height']
        city = employee_data['City']
        state = employee_data['State']
        employee = Employee(name, dob, height, city, state)
        employee_list.append(employee)

for employee in employee_list:
    print("Name:", employee.name)
    print("DOB:", employee.dob)
    print("Height:", employee.height)
    print("City:", employee.city)
    print("State:", employee.state)
    print()

## 2. Create a dictionary of any 7 Indian states and their capitals. Write this into a JSON file.

import json
states = {
    "Tamil Nadu": "Chennai",
    "karnataka" : "Banglore",
    "kerala"    : "Thirvanandapuram",
    "West Bengal": "Kolkata",
    "Maharashtra": "Mumbai",
    "Bihar": "Patna",
    "Gujarat": "Gandhinagar"
}
with open('states.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(states, file)
print("Indian States with thier capitals in json\n")

## Assignment 2
 #1. Create a class named ‘Dog’. It should have a constructor which accepts its name, age and coat color. You must perform the following operations:
    #a. It should have a function ‘description()’ which prints the name and age of the dog.
    #b. It should have a function ‘get_info()’ which prints the coat color of the dog.
    #c. Create child classes ‘JackRussellTerrier’ and ‘Bulldog’ which is inherited from the class ‘Dog’. It should have at least two methods of its own.
    #d. Create objects and implement the above functionalities.

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age, coat_color):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.coat_color = coat_color

    def description(self):
        print("Name:", self.name)
        print("Age:", self.age)

    def get_info(self):
        print("Coat Color:", self.coat_color)


class JackRussellTerrier(Dog):
    def _init_(self, name, age, coat_color):
        super()._init_(name, age, coat_color)

    def intelligent(self):
        print(self.name, "Doing mathematics understand human languages quickly")

    def courageous(self):
        print(self.name, "Never afraid for enemies")
    
class Bulldog(Dog):
    def _init_(self, name, age, coat_color):
        super()._init_(name, age, coat_color)

    def homeguard (self):
        print(self.name, "find out enemies and bad people")

    def activeness(self):
        print(self.name, "Actively helping people and playful")

dog1 = Dog("Juli", 3, "Brown")
dog1.description()
dog1.get_info()
print()

dog2 = JackRussellTerrier("Rocky", 3, "Black")
dog2.description()
dog2.get_info()
dog2.intelligent()
dog2.courageous()
print()

dog3 = Bulldog("Simba", 4, "White")
dog3.description()
dog3.get_info()
dog3.homeguard()
dog3.activeness()
